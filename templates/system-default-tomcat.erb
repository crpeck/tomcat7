# You may pass JVM startup parameters to Java here. If unset, the default
# options will be: -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
#
# Use "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" to enable the CMS garbage collector (improved
# response time). If you use that option and you run Tomcat on a machine with
# exactly one CPU chip that contains one or two cores, you should also add
# the "-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode" option.
